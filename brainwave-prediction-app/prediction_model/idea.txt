brainflow streamer param parsing
https://github.com/brainflow-dev/brainflow/blob/master/src/board_controller/board.cpp#L373
"format is streamer_type://streamer_dest:streamer_args"

how it is used is here
https://github.com/brainflow-dev/brainflow/blob/master/src/board_controller/board.cpp#L267

supported streamers:
    file - file://
    multicast - streaming_board://
    plotjuggler_udp - plotjuggler_udp://

this is the board we are using:
https://github.com/brainflow-dev/brainflow/blob/master/src/board_controller/openbci/inc/cyton_daisy.h
https://github.com/brainflow-dev/brainflow/blob/master/src/board_controller/openbci/cyton_daisy.cpp

BRAINFLOW_BATCH_SIZE is an env variable that controls the number of data packages that are sent

Actually this is not the data that is sent, it is the data used internally
The data that is sent is in the format of:
https://docs.openbci.com/Software/OpenBCISoftware/GUIDocs/#cyton
array[32] of doubles:
    0: sample number
    1-8: eeg data (cyton board)
    9-16: eeg data (daisy board)
    17-19: accel data
    20: unused
    21-24: digital channel 0-3 (not used for us)
    25: unused
    26: digital channel 4 (not used for us)
    27-29: analog channel 0-2
    30: timestamp
    31: marker


/*
        Byte 1: 0xA0
        Byte 2: Sample Number
        Bytes 3-5: Data value for EEG channel 1
        Bytes 6-8: Data value for EEG channel 2
        Bytes 9-11: Data value for EEG channel 3
        Bytes 12-14: Data value for EEG channel 4
        Bytes 15-17: Data value for EEG channel 5

        Bytes 21-23: Data value for EEG channel 6
        Bytes 24-26: Data value for EEG channel 8
        Aux Data Bytes 27-32: 6 bytes of data
        Byte 33: 0xCX where X is 0-F in hex
